I am Tianhua Zou, a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Economics at Renmin University of China (RUC), currently spending a year at Stanford University as a visiting scholar. My research focuses on environmental policies, energy consumption, and poverty alleviation, with a particular interest in the adoption of electric vehicles. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Lunyu Xie at RUC and Prof. Shanjun Li at Stanford.
