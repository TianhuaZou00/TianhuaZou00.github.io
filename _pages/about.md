I am Tianhua Zou (邹恬华), a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Economics at Renmin University of China (RUC), currently a visiting scholar at the Stanford Center on China’s Economy and Institutions (SCCEI). My research focuses on environmental policies, energy consumption, and poverty alleviation, with a particular interest in the adoption of electric vehicles. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Lunyu Xie at RUC, and by Professors Scott Rozelle and Shanjun Li at Stanford.
