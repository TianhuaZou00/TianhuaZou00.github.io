I am Tianhua Zou, a Ph.D. student in Applied Economics at Renmin University of China (RUC). My research focuses on energy consumption and environmental policy, with a particular interest in consumers' adoption and usage behaviors of electric vehicles (EVs) and their environmental impacts. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Lunyu Xie at RUC.
